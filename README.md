# Are there places in the world that are more affected than others by the fall of meteorites?

Using the Fireballs dataset, which includes the information on fireballs detected since 1988 and 2017 with a total of 719 records, and the Meteorites Landing dataset, which includes all the meteorites detected from the year 300 to 2017 with a total of 45,716, we will see if it is possible to reach some conclusion about it. Both datasets were compiled by NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).
